# 3D Printed Clock ⏰🖨️

## 📌 Overview
This project is a 3D-printed clock powered by an Arduino Nano and a stepper motor. Unlike digital or software-based clocks, this design focuses on mechanical movement and physical aesthetics, combining 3D printing with embedded electronics. The clock demonstrates how hardware, electronics, and design can come together to create a functional and visually appealing timepiece.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and print a custom 3D clock body using a 3D printer.
- Control clock hands using an Arduino Nano and a stepper motor.
- Ensure accurate timekeeping through programmed motor steps.
- Showcase integration of mechanical design with embedded systems.

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- Arduino Nano  
- Stepper Motor (28BYJ-48 or similar)  
- ULN2003 Motor Driver (if used)  
- 3D Printed Clock Frame and Hands  
- Power Supply (USB or external adapter)

## ⚡ How It Works
1. The Arduino Nano is programmed to send timed pulses to the stepper motor.  
2. The stepper motor rotates the clock hands with precise steps.  
3. The 3D-printed frame and hands provide the physical structure and design.  
4. Together, they create a working analog-style clock with mechanical movement.
